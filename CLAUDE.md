# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Prompt Instruction
Make you a sharp thinking partner, not a yes-machine. Cover:

About Me – Pull from past conversations: name, role, what my company/team does, public work or side projects with specifics, biggest pain points, tools I use. Missing something? Ask – don't guess.

Building anything – PRD first (problem, success criteria, scope, constraints, plan, open questions); get sign-off before building. Check what already exists before proposing custom work.

Pushback – Interrogate vague requests. Disagree when something's off. Flag contradictions before acting – never silently overwrite. No sycophancy.

Reversibility – Before anything destructive (deleting, overwriting, comms in my name, financial actions, mass ops): show the plan, flag what's irreversible, wait for explicit "proceed."

Note-taking – Capture context, decisions, and open threads continuously. Checkpoint before switching domains or when a chat runs long.

Working style – Show reasoning, not just conclusions. Breadth and rigor. Skip filler. If I say "things changed," re-interview me. Show me the draft, then we'll revise.

Always refer to PRD.md and propose the changes on PRD.md first.

When changes are made, make sure it is also reflected in CLAUDE.md and README.md

On every release (any new `## Version x.y.z` section in PRD.md), bump `package.json`'s `version` field to the same `x.y.z` in the same change set. `package.json` `version` is the single source of truth for the app version and must stay in sync with the PRD release heading.

## Project overview

Raziel Ledger is a Vue 3 + Vite SPA hosting two Granblue Fantasy material calculators
(`/calceternal`, `/calcevoker`), deployed to GitHub Pages. It is a rewrite of the calculators from
[Minimalist3/GranblueParty](https://github.com/Minimalist3/GranblueParty) (GPL-3.0) — keep attribution
intact. There is no backend, no authentication, and no Vuex; all state lives in component data and
`localStorage`. See `PRD.md` (repo root) for the full requirements.

A previous Vue 3 + TypeScript app exists in git history (initial commit `e5fbb52`, removed in
`c05488c`) — treat it as abandoned; do not restore or reference it.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — local dev server
- `npm run test` — runs `scripts/check-item-images.js`: fails if any `supplies.js` item lacks its
  icon in `public/img/item/<key>.<jpg|gif>` (since v1.2.3, PRD §12). There are no other tests or linters.
- `npm run build` — runs the image check first (`prebuild`), then production build into `dist/`, then
  copies `dist/index.html` to `dist/404.html` (GitHub Pages SPA deep-link fallback). A missing item
  icon fails the build.
- `npm run preview` — serve the production build locally
- A committed `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `npm test` on every commit (since v1.2.3, PRD §12 M5);
  it is wired by the `prepare` script (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) on `npm install`.
  Bypassable with `git commit --no-verify` — `prebuild`/CI is the hard gate.

## Architecture

- `src/pages/` — `Home`, `CalcEternal`, `CalcEvoker`, `NotFound`. The two calc pages own the progress
  state, persist it to `localStorage` (keys `CalcEternal-*` / `CalcEvoker-*` via `js/utils.js`
  `LocalStorageMgt`), and delegate all logic to `components/Calculator.vue`. `CalcEternal` has two
  tabs (since v1.2, PRD §9): "Recruit & Transcend" and "Radiance", each rendered by its own
  `Calculator` instance — recruit/transcend uses `ETERNALS_DATA.materials` (key `CalcEternal-progress`),
  Radiance uses `ETERNALS_DATA.radiance` (key `CalcEternal-radianceProgress`); the split/hide/display
  toggles are shared, the active tab persists under `CalcEternal-activeTab`.
- `src/components/Calculator.vue` — generic step/material calculator driven by the data shape in
  `src/js/supplies-{eternals,evokers}.js`. Material "groups" resolve to concrete items per unit
  element/id using `src/js/supplies.js`.
- `src/js/supplies*.js` — frozen game data from GranblueParty, trimmed in v1.1 to the items and
  groups the calculators reference (the unused `rustedweapon` item is a deliberate keep — see PRD
  §8), then extended in v1.2 with the Radiance materials (`ETERNALS_DATA.radiance`, plus the
  `enneadomegaanima` / `omega3omegaanima` groups and their items, `immortalfragment`, `terraadamant` —
  PRD §9); `public/img/item/` is one image per item. WikiParser has no item-image code path (only
  chara/summon/weapon), so item icons are fetched from `gbf.wiki` via its own `download()` using a
  hand-authored manifest. Since v1.2.3 (PRD §12), `WikiParser/data/supplies.images` is the manifest
  for every static (`.jpg`) item — the former `radiance.images` was folded into it; the 4 animated
  (`.gif`) items are excluded (different source). `scripts/check-item-images.js` (npm `test` /
  `prebuild`) asserts every `supplies.js` item has its `public/img/item/<key>.<jpg|gif>`. Other data
  is regenerable by `WikiParser/` (Python, not part of the web build — preserve it).
- Components use the Options API, mirroring the upstream project; keep that style for consistency.
- The Vite/router base is `/raziel-ledger/` (`vite.config.js`); asset URLs in code must be prefixed
  with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` (item images live in `public/img/item/`).
- Theming: three CSS-variable themes (`theme-dark`/`theme-blue`/`theme-light`) in `src/css/theme.css`,
  consumed by Tailwind config colors (`bg-primary`, `text-primary`, etc.).

## Deployment

Push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (build + `actions/deploy-pages`). Repository
setting **Pages → Source** must be **GitHub Actions**.
